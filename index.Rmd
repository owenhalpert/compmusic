## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(spotifyr)
library("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggthemes")                     # Install ggthemes package
library("ggthemes")

coachella2023 <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "2HfbF1Xx4RHhJI8jNvQAQb")

coachella20232 <- coachella2023 %>%                    # Start with awards.
  mutate(
    mode = ifelse(mode == 0, "Minor", "Major")
  )

ggplot(coachella20232, aes(x = valence, y = energy, size = danceability, color = mode)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(x = "Valence", y = "Energy", color = "Mode", size = "Danceability", title = "Coachella 2023") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()

coachella2022 <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "2tcwxeUSNT7gYMzidaf5W1")

coachella20222 <- coachella2022 %>%                    # Start with awards.
  mutate(
    mode = ifelse(mode == 0, "Minor", "Major")
  )

ggplot(coachella20222, aes(x = valence, y = energy, size = danceability, color = mode)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(x = "Valence", y = "Energy", color = "Mode", size = "Danceability", title = "Coachella 2022") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
